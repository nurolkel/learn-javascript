// Create two variables, name and greeting. The name variable should store your name,
// and the greeting should store e.g. "Hi, my name is "
const name = 'Kelvin Nunez'
const greeting = "Hi, my name is "


// Create a third variable, myGreeting, that contatenates the two strings
const myGreeting = greeting + name;
console.log(myGreeting);

// Log myGreeting to the console
